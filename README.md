# BANK MARKETING CUSTOMER PREDICTION ANALYSIS DASHBOARD FOR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
# Situation
The bank aims to enhance its marketing campaign by identifying target customers more likely to purchase their products. Using a dataset collected from kaggle website ,containing customer demographics, financial information, and past campaign interactions, the project seeks to develop a classification model to predict whether a customer will buy the product. Key variables include age, job, marital status, education, balance, loan status, contact type, and campaign details. The analysis will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,  and   to provide actionable insights, ultimately improving campaign effectiveness, customer targeting, and resource optimization.
# Task
As a Data Analyst in this project,i was resposible for  developing a robust classification model that accurately predicts whether a customer will purchase a banking product based on their demographic, financial, and interaction data.I worked personally by putting more effort to this project to identify the most relevant customers who will buy the bank products and key metrics to track and analyse this data. I then used Excel, one of the most popular and powerful data visualization tools, to create an interactive dashboard that would allow users to explore the data and gain insights.
# Action
The action plan  for this project involves leveraging Excel to systematically analyze the bank's marketing dataset to predict customer purchasing behavior. Started by importing the dataset into Excel and cleaning the data, ensuring no missing values and proper encoding of categorical variables. Use IF statements to categorize customers into age groups and employ Excel's data analysis tools to conduct exploratory analysis, identifying trends and correlations and finally building reports using pivot tables and utilizing slicers for dynamic interactions.
 Finally,  i compile the findings into a detailed report and create visualizations to present actionable insights that can optimize the bank's marketing efforts and improve decision making.The preview of the dashboard is available below.

# Recommendations
- Customers in the age categories 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 20-29 exhibit the highest purchasing power. Prioritize marketing efforts toward these age groups to maximize conversions and sales.
- Management customers group has the highest purchasing power among all job titles. They should be the primary focus for targeted marketing campaigns. Technicians, Blue-collar, Admin, and Retired, these groups also show significant purchasing power and should be secondary targets in the campaigns.
- High-Income Job Titles like  Entrepreneurs, Management, Services, Self-employed, and Technicians customers have the highest salary incomes. These groups are more likely to afford premium products and services. Tailor high-end offerings and personalized campaigns to attract these segments.
- Low-Income Groups like Retired, Admin, Blue-collar, Students, Unemployed, Self-employed, House maids, and Unknown customers have lower salary incomes. Design cost-effective and value-based offerings that cater to their financial capabilities. Emphasize affordability and benefits that align with their needs.
- Age and Job Title Combination: Targeting the high purchasing power age groups (30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 20-29) within the high salary and high purchasing power job titles (Management, Technicians, Blue-collar, Admin, Retired). This strategy ensures a focused approach towards customers segments with the highest potential for conversion.

Through the successful completion of this project, i have gained invaluable insights into the bank's customer purchasing behavior, demonstrating the power of data-driven decision-making. By leveraging Excel for data analysis, i identified key demographics and job categories with the highest purchasing power and success rates. This project underscored the importance of targeting high-potential customer segments and customizing marketing strategies to fit their unique profiles. The process also highlighted the necessity of continuous monitoring and adjustment based on real-time data. Overall, this project has reinforced the critical role of data analytics in optimizing marketing efforts and driving business growth.
