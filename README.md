# BANK MARKETING CUSTOMER PREDICTION ANALYSIS DASHBOARD FOR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
# Situation
The bank aims to enhance its marketing campaign by identifying target customers more likely to purchase their products. Using a dataset collected from kaggle website ,containing customer demographics, financial information, and past campaign interactions, the project seeks to develop a classification model to predict whether a customer will buy the product. Key variables include age, job, marital status, education, balance, loan status, contact type, and campaign details. The analysis will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,  and   to provide actionable insights, ultimately improving campaign effectiveness, customer targeting, and resource optimization.
# Task
As a Data Analyst in this project,i was resposible for  developing a robust classification model that accurately predicts whether a customer will purchase a banking product based on their demographic, financial, and interaction data.I worked personally by putting more effort to this project to identify the most relevant customers who will buy the bank products and key metrics to track and analyse this data. I then used Excel, one of the most popular and powerful data visualization tools, to create an interactive dashboard that would allow users to explore the data and gain insights.
# Action
The action plan  for this project involves leveraging Excel to systematically analyze the bank's marketing dataset to predict customer purchasing behavior. Started by importing the dataset into Excel and cleaning the data, ensuring no missing values and proper encoding of categorical variables. Use IF statements to categorize customers into age groups and employ Excel's data analysis tools to conduct exploratory analysis, identifying trends and correlations and finally building reports using pivot tables and utilizing slicers for dynamic interactions.
 Finally,  i compile the findings into a detailed report and create visualizations to present actionable insights that can optimize the bank's marketing efforts and improve decision making.The preview of the dashboard is available below.

 # Result
 The dashboard has been a tremendous success, providing valuable insights into the progress of customer puchasing program. Some of the quantifiable results of the project include:
 - Customers between age category 30-39 contributes to the highest purchasing power followed by 40-49,50-59,20-29 and age category of 60-69,70-79,80-89,90-99 and 10-19 contributes to lowest turn out of purchasing power.
 - Management contibues to highest purchasing power among customer job titles followed by technician,blue-collar,admin and retied while service,students,unemployed,self-employed,enterprenuers,house maid and unkown contributes to low turn out in purchasing power.
 - Entreprenuers,management,services,self-employed and technicians are among customer's job titles with highest salaries income compared to retied,admin.blue-collar,students,unemployed,self-employed,house maids,unkown and students have very low income salaries.
 - Predictive model for success rate is provided below using excel and vlookups.
